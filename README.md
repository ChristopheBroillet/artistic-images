# Mini-Project: Artistic effects on images
This repository contains all the material for the mini-project of the *Digital Image Processing* course, Autumn Semester 2022 at the University of Fribourg.

The code is written in a Jupyter notebook. To run it, first create a virtual environment with *pipenv* using the command `pipenv sync` or `pipenv install`.
One can then run a Jupyter server using `pipenv run jupyter notebook`, and then navigate through the GUI from Jupyter.
