# Mini-Project: Artistic effects on images
This repository contains all the material for the mini-project of the *Digital Image Processing* course, Autumn Semester 2022 at the University of Fribourg. The goal of this project was to implement three artistic effects on color images:
1. Oil painting effect
2. Aging effect
3. Mosaic effect

The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook. To run it, first create a virtual environment with *pipenv* using the command `pipenv sync` or `pipenv install`.
One can then run a Jupyter server using `pipenv run jupyter notebook`, and open the Notebook.

To test the artistic effects, use the `Restart & Run All` button from the `Kernel` menu inside the Notebook. At the end of the Notebook are some interactions to modify and test the artistic effects.


## Examples

Here are some examples of the three implemented effects.
